      In order to be more productive we started splitting our team into specialised roles according to our skills. These include:</p>
      	<p style="margin-left: 20px">1. Molecular Biology - Eloise, Catherine, Stefanie</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">2. Modelling - Pengli, Stefan, Catherine</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">3. Entrepreneurship and collaborations (incl. outreach) - Giovanni, Matas, Viktoria, Agata</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">4. Marketing and Website (incl. social media) - Daniel, Jacopo DC, Jacopo G</p>
    <p>After a few weeks of brainstorming project ideas we had narrowed it down to two options: heavy metal filtration or electric genes. Through a final vote we decided to work on a project on rare metal recycling (however idea changed over the following weeks).

      We secured GenScript’s sponsorship! This will be very valuable for our constructs once they are ready. While we were looking for a suitable scaffold for metal filters we read about spider silk for the first time. Its incredible mechanical properties and biodegradability convinced us to focus our project on it. </p>

After running into slight issues due to the repetitive nature of spider silk sequences, our constructs were finally ready to be ordered. The UCL Synthetic Biology Showcase took place on Wednesday, allowing us to hear about cutting edge research in this field. We also got a chance to present our project and gather feedback. Our conversation with a representative GenScript proved to be very helpful for our presentation skills.

    <p>Dr Michael Baron introduced us to GitHub and its basic commands. On Thursday we travelled to Oxford for the UK iGEM Meetup organised by SynBio UK. We learned about other team’s project and planned collaborations based on our strengths and weaknesses. Hearing a member of Imperial’s 2014 team Aqualose was particularly inspiring as their project is relevant to ours and proved to be successful. Through different workshops in safety and project planning we developed our idea further.

    <p>The outreach team had brainstorming sessions deciding how they can communicate science to the public in an effective manner. We had the idea of creating a DIY bioreactor and Matas started planning a design. Helsinki approached us as they are also working with spider silk and sharing protocols will benefit us both.
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion_column" >
    <div class="h4_notebook">Wet Lab Overview</div>
    <p>We digested the backbones with EcoRI and PstI and checked the plasmids with SYBR Safe on an agarose gel. Stock solutions of various buffers such as lithium acetate were prepared. We also started with the transformation of our construct, Final Brick, which allows flexible cloning with BioBrick, Golden Gate and Gibson. At the same time we amplified our constructs through PCR.

    <p>Our modelling team (Stefan, Pengli and Catherine) is working on a predictive model for spider silk properties and tested it with a supercomputer. Meanwhile the outreach team, including Giovanni and Jacopo G, created a informative podcast published on Loq. about biocontainment with a vocabulary suited for the general public.

  <div class="accordion_column" >
    <div class="h4_notebook">Wet Lab Overview</div>
    <p>In a joint team effort we cloned the Final Brick into all backbones through Golden Gate. In the photo below the blue-white screening can be seen. The agarose-gel electrophoresis of digested plasmids showed the Final Brick at the expected size. We picked blue colonies for sequencing and they were confirmed to be correct! This is a great success as it allows us to continue with the production of spider silk. There are various constructs we need to clone, some of which need to be assembled first.

    <p>Our PCR assemblies of spidroins have been unsuccessful so we started focusing on Gibson Assembly. We used 50 ng of vector and 150 ng of insert as recommended by NEB for a 3-fragment assembly and transformed the ligated product into E. coli DH5α. As seen on the gel below, the N and C terminus of spider silk seem to have been cloned. The second gel shows the spider silk spidroins, only SS2C4 has the expected size. During our meeting we discussed the difficulties in assembly and decided to order complete g-blocks instead.

    <p>Giovanni talked to the CSO of Bolt Threads about spider silk and our project. Bolt Threads is a pioneer in the commercialisation of spider silk and offered us valuable insight into their experience. They highlighted the importance of biomaterials and that alternatives to spider silk such as collagen are equally useful. We discussed this during our weekly meeting and decided to focus on the polymerisation and functionalisation of biomaterials. This is possible through our GFP and RFP constructs flanked by inteins as well as our “Intein Passenger”.
We also had a discussion with Dr. Chris Myers about his research in genetic circuits. He brought up the importance of modularity in Synthetic Biology, which further encouraged us to change the direction of our project.
Together with Yelena Petrovskaya, a UCL psychology student, the data from the psychological study was analysed using ANOVA.

    <p>Based on our discussion with Bolt Threads, we focused our effort into our intein RFP and GFP constructs. We tried different methods simultaneously. As it can be seen from our gel, our initial Gibson Assembly gave very smeared bands. The bands were excised however they resulted in very low DNA concentrations which could not be used. We also attempted a cell-free expression of RFP which did not work.

    <p>We went to Open Cell to approach some start-ups. The ones which inspired us, and were most relevant, included WASE-tech and IndiCo. WASE is working on water filtration, they told us about their vision to use bacterial biofilms in the future to clean water in a natural manner. Alternatively, IndiCo was developing bacterial patterning of clothing. The pigment was patterned onto the textiles, this made us wonder about whether chromoproteins could be used to functionalise spider silk and apply colour directly. <br>
As we are having some issues integrating our animations into the Wiki format we contacted Florin, team member of UCL’s2017 iGEM team, to help us.
	This week we also had our great London collaboration with other universities. We troubleshooted with King’s College, Imperial College and Westminster.

    <p> Gibson Assembly of RFP, GFP and Intein Passenger were successful! They were transformed into DH5α, mini-prepped, digested with BsaI and the results can be seen below. The bands correspond to the correct sizes of our GFP, RPF and Intein Passenger constructs and the samples were sent for sequencing. The sequencing results for RFP and Intein Passenger came back positive, however GFP contains an additional sequence in between part 1 and 2.

Protein<br>
Our RFP, GFP and Intein Passenger plasmids were transformed into E. Coli BL21 for expression. As seen in the photo below, the expression was successful. They were induced with 400 μM IPTG when OD reached 0.6. Expression was done overnight at 25˚C and 37˚C to test for optimal conditions. Some of our 50 ml LB overnight cultures were contaminated and had to be repeated. Fluorescence was measured using our BMG plate reader.
The cells were sonicated, and the proteins purified and run on an SDS gel.<br>

As the Intein Passenger is ready we can start cloning in our nickel binding peptide (NikR) and our estrogen binding peptide (ER). We first amplified them through PCR, as seen on the first gel. Another attempt of GFP cloning gave the second gel; it looks like GFP2C1 (colony 1) could have worked.
To compare our improved mScarlet-intein BBa_K2842669 construct to Heidelberg’s 2014 RFP-intein construct BBa_K1362101, we cloned their construct into BL21 cells.

Our new GFP Gibson Assemblies were sent for sequencing. A colony PCR of Intein Passenger containing NikR and ER gave a promising gel. These samples were also sent for sequencing and confirmed to be correct. Our constructs were prepared to be shipped to Boston.
